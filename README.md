# Capture The Mark

Repo containing the material for the competition Capture the Mark for the course Data Hiding (Multimedia Data Security). The aim of the competition is embedding a digital watermark in a 512x512 grayscale image and attacking the images generated by the other gorups. Here you can find our embedding strategy (with the correspondent algorithm for the detection of our watermark), our attack scripts and many investigation and test files. You can also find in pdf format the slides for our presentation of the work.

Our group is called pixel and we finished #5 in the competition (out of 11 groups). We were also mentioned as the team with better defensive phase, since the other grups needed to degradate a lot the quality of our image in order to remove the mark.
